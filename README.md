# MIni_SQL_Engine

Built a Mini SQL Engine which was able to parse queries and perform basic operations such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE along with aggregate operations such as MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), and JOINS. The whole project was coded in Python.

The command is as follows
	python minisql.py "<sql query without semicolon in the end>"
The metadata.txt file and the csv files which represent the data should be stored in the "files" folder which is present in the directory from where you are running the code
